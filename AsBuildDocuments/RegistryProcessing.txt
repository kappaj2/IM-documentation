Clone the JHipster registry from the JHipster registry repo.

Create an executable so we can start the war file locally.
Until moving to production we compile with the dev profile.

$ ./mvnw clean install -Dprofile=dev
$ ls -ltr ./target/
This will list all the stuff in the build folder. Look for the .war file.
ie : jhipster-registry-3.2.4.war

Start using mvnw -  use the dev properties.....
$ ./target/jhipster-registry-3.2.4.war --spring.profiles.active=dev --security.user.password=admin \
      --jhipster.security.authentication.jwt.secret=secret-key \
      --spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/kappaj2/IM-ProfileConfig-dev

The first time you need to run yarn to be able to access the UI.
$ yarn install
$ yarn start

When the Registry application have been build with the prod profile, you will be able to run without starting
yarn as all the ui stuff will have been compiled and added to the target.
Until then you must run mvn and yarn in parallel to be able to access the UI.
Yarn will start the UI on port 9000 (or which ever it finds open) and not on 8761
