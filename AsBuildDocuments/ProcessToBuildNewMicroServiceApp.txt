Run the following commands to create a new JHipster microservice application"
$ jhipster (This is with the bash_profile link setup)
$ Select Microservice application
$ Base name of the application is the module name (note: - not allowed), ie : BillingModule
$ Select the next available port for the port-configuration.txt file.
$ Java package structure is as follows:
    za.co.ajk.billing
    Only the first part of the module name - all in lower case.
$ Select JHipster as registry provider
$ Select JWT as authentication
$ Select SQL as database. Note that we will be adding MongoDB for message logging later on.
$ Select MySQL as production DB. PostgreSQL is still in Beta on GoogleCloudPlatform
$ Select MySQL as development DB as well.
    Select Hazelcast as cash.
$ Select Hibernate L2 cache
$ Select Maven as build tool
$ Enable Elasticsearch
$ Enable Internationalization - English and Dutch
$ Enable both Gatling and Cucumber testing frameworks.
$ no additional generators.

Maven will now download and build the project - ensure the registry project is running before starting to build a microservice.

Complete the git setup and push to github.

Now setup the MySQL configuration properties.
Only do the development stuff for now.
In application-dev.yml file update to info:
      datasource:
          type: com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource
          url: jdbc:mysql://35.189.80.178:3306/billing?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&useSSL=false
          username: billing-user
          password: qazwsxedc

You should be able to start the microservice with running mvn command
$ ./mvnw
The database should have the changelog tables created by Liquibase.
