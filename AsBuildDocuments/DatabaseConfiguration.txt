The different modules uses different databases.
For GoogleCloudPlatform use the following:

Region: europe-west2
Zone  : any

Enable the Cloud SQL API before accessing the database.

All the micro services will also run in this region as their primary region - keep the DB's close to
the servers.

Instance ID : spry-ivy-182707:europe-west2:dev-im

MySQL V5.7 (Second Generation) is used by the following modules:
Server IP       Port      username            password        schema
35.189.80.178   3306      billing-user        qazwsxedc       billing
35.189.80.178   3306      inventory-user      qazwsxedc       inventory
35.189.80.178   3306      workflow-user       qazwsxedc       activiti
35.189.80.178   3306      event-user          qazwsxedc       events
35.189.80.178   3306      integration-user    qazwsxedc       integration
35.189.80.178   3306      gateway-user        qazwsxedc       gateway

There are a couple of ways to connect to the DB. For development we will use just ip access

1.  Connect using MySQL workbench.
  a.  Get your laptop's IP address (whatismyip o similar)
  b.  Go to the instance manager on GoogleCloud
      (https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/dev-im/databases?project=spry-ivy-182707)
  c.  Go to Authorization
  d.  Add a new network with your machines IP address.
  This should be it. Need to do it for all the IP's in the MicrosService instances that is running locally.
  For development it should suffice.

//  This needs to be unpacked and updated further.
2.  From Kubernetes
  Here we need to create service accounts and configure them correctly.



Connect from local Mac using the SQL Proxy Client
curl -o cloud_sql_proxy https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.darwin.amd64
Now create a service account:
  AccountName : SQLCloudAdmin
  Role : Cloud SQL SQLCloudAdmin
  ServiceAccountId : sqlcloudadmin
  TestProject-5daced065380.json

  AccountName : SQLCloudClient
  Role : Cloud SQL Client
  ServiceAccountId : sqlcloudclient
  TestProject-301279c7a186.json

Create the JSON file(s) and download them.

gcloud sql users create proxyuser cloudsqlproxy~% --instance=im-dev --password=qazwsxedc
