Running the different mvn commands require a profile to determine the correct runtime env variables. Start the mvn command speicifying the appropriate role set to use.

IE: Run mvn clean install to clean, build and run all the unit test:

$ mvn clean install -Dspring.profiles.active=dev,swagger
This will run with the dev and swagger roles.

Note: With this command the module will not use the JHipster registry config server to retrieve the properties required.

So the following will be used:
/main/resources/config/application.yml and the override application-dev.yml

All the required props must be available in these two yml files.
